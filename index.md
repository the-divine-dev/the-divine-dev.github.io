## Welcome!

The purpose of this site is to share my learning journey of **memorizing** the lyrical, rhythmic, unique poetic hymns of the medieval Tamil poet, Mystic, and Saint *aruNagirinAtha bhagavAn*.

### What I Will Do

**Eliminate Typos**:
Publishers inadvertently introduce typos when distributing Tamil literature. They also tend to "split" joined words. I will painstakingly compare several publications of aruNagirinAtha's Words and attempt to publish a version without typos here.

**Define Challenging Words**:
I assume readers' ability to read Tamil and English, and maybe Devanagari script too. I will define difficult Tamil words in English or Tamil to aid in memorization. Knowing each word's meaning makes memorizing easier and learning very rewarding.

Saint aruNagiri uses a beautiful heavily Sanskritized Tamil vocabulary, so I will point out Sanskrit words and indicate their pronunciation using the [Harvard-Kyoto convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard-Kyoto) in English or devanAgarI script. I'll also define Sanskrit words in either Tamil or English.

### Dedication to the Spiritual Masters
```markdown
सदाशिव समारम्भां शंकराचार्य मध्यमाम् ।
अस्मदाचार्य पर्यन्तां वन्दे गुरुपरंपराम् ॥

```
I worship the Lineage of Gurus, with God Shiva at the very beginning, with Saint-Philosopher-Theologian Adi Shankaracharya in the middle, and my Personal Master (Saint aruNagiri, in my case) at the end.
